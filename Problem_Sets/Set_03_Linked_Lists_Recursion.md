# Problem Set 3 - Linked Lists, Recursion

## Problem 1

`*` Given the following definition of a circular linked list (CLL) class:

```java
public class Node {
   public String data;
   public Node   next;

   public Node(String data, Node next) {
      this.data = data;
      this.next = next;
   }
}
```

```java
public class LinkedList {
   private Node rear;  // pointer to last node of CLL

   // ...
}
```

The class keeps a circular linked list, with a rear pointer to the last node.

Implement the following method in the `LinkedList` class, to delete the _first_ occurrence of a given item from the linked list. The method returns true if the item is deleted, or false if the item is not found.

```java
public boolean delete(String target) {
   // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
}
```

## Problem 2

`*` Implement a method in the circular linked list class of problem 1, to add a new item _after_ the first occurrence (from the front) of a specified item. If the item does not exist in the list, the method should return false, otherwise true.

```java
public boolean addAfter(String newItem, String afterItem) {
   // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
}
```

## Problem 3

A doubly linked list (DLL) is a linked list with nodes that point both forward and backward. Here's an example:

```
3 <---> 5 <---> 7 <---> 1
```

Here's a DLL node definition:

```java
public class DLLNode {
   public String  data;
   public DLLNode prev, next;

   public DLLNode(String data, DLLNode next, DLLNode prev) {
      this.data = data;
      this.next = next;
      this.prev = prev;
   }
}
```

The next of the last node will be `null`, and the prev of the first node will be `null`.

Implement a method to move a node (given a pointer to it) to the front of a DLL.

```java
// moves target to front of DLL
public static DLLNode moveToFront(DLLNode front, DLLNode target) {
   // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
}
```

## Problem 4

With the same `DLLNode` definition as in the previous problem, implement a method to reverse the sequence of items in a DLL. Your code should NOT create any new nodes - it should simply resequence the original nodes. The method should return the front of the resulting list.

```java
public static DLLNode reverse(DLLNode front) {
   // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
}
```

## Problem 5

Implement a RECURSIVE method to delete all occurrences of an item from a (non-circular) linked list. Use the `Node` class definition of [Problem 1](#problem-1). Return a pointer to the first node in the updated list.

```java
public static Node deleteAll(Node front, String target) {
   // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
}
```

## Problem 6

`*` Implement a RECURSIVE method to merge two **sorted** linked lists into a single **sorted** linked list WITHOUT duplicates. No new nodes must be created: the nodes in the result list are a subset of the nodes in the original lists, rearranged appropriately. You may assume that the original lists do not have any duplicate items.

For instance:

```
l1 = 3->9->12->15
l2 = 2->3->6->12
```

should result in the following:

```
2->3->6->9->12->15
```

Assuming a `Node` class defined like this:

```java
public class Node {
   public int  data;
   public Node next;
}
```

Complete the following method:

```java
public static Node merge(Node frontL1, Node frontL2) {
   // COMPLETE THIS METHOD
}
```
